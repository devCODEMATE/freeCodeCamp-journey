    <h1>Pasta Frola de Batata</h1>
    <p>
I've been making pasta frola for a long time. And this one, like many recipes, I always made "by feel." Culinary art, like many others, involves a bit of that...learning the technique, a few tricks and details, and then going out to create. This time, we're going for the complete recipe.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>100g butter</li>
      <li>150g sugar</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>400g self-raising flour</li>
      <li>500g sweet potato</li>
    <ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>DOUGH
Mix and beat the butter (or margarine) with the sugar. Add the eggs one by one and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add 300 grams of flour and mix everything until the ingredients are combined. Turn the dough out onto the work surface on top of the remaining flour.</li>
        <li>Knead until you obtain a smooth dough...almost sticky to the touch. It shouldn't be too wet or too hard. Separate 1/4 of the dough.</li>
        <li>Line a baking dish with the remaining dough</li>
        <li>FILLING. Cut the quince paste into small cubes and place it in a saucepan. Add a small cup of water to the saucepan.</li>
        <li>Cook over very low heat until the paste softens. Use a fork and a wooden spatula to mash any “stubborn pieces.”</li>
        <li>ASSEMBLY. Spread the filling over the pan already lined with dough. Cut the reserved 1/4 of dough in half.</li>
        <li>Use one half to make long dough strips and place them over the filling. Make more strips to layer and crisscross over the first ones.</li>
        <li>BAKING. Bake the pasta frola in a low oven for 50 minutes.</li>
